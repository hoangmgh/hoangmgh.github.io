Hi, welcome to my personal blog!


I am  an Associate Computational Biologist at the [Villani Lab](https://villani.mgh.harvard.edu/), where we use single-cell genomics technology to study autoimmunity and autoimmunity-like iRAE induced by checkpoint inhibitors.

Prior to this, I double-majored in Mathematics and Computational Biology at Colby College. During my undergraduate, I was  privileged to be mentored by [Dr. Nam Sy Vo](https://vingen.vinbigdata.org/en/teams/vo-sy-nam/) at the Vingroup BigData and [Dr. Alice Lee](https://compgen.hms.harvard.edu/)   at the Boston Children's Hospital, where I studied functional genomics and the landscape of Transposable Elements in Alzheimer's, respectively. 

**Research:** I am interested in computational methods development and modelling frameworks for nextgen sequencing data, particularly single-cell multi-omics data. I am also captivated by the genetic noncoding elements in complex disease, such as Autoimmunity and Alzheimer's Disease. My learning philosophy is by doing and reinventing the wheels - which I think are very rewarding and challenging simultaneously. Sometimes dissecting existing tools will help us learn about the conventional way of doing and maybe invent our  methods along the way.  

**Trivia:** I love collecting film lenses, doing photography, painting, making architecture diorama, and teaching in the free time. Check out my Arts and Blog sections for some of the works I have done or are WIP.
