Hi, welcome to my personal blog!


I am  an Associate Computational Biologist at the [Villani Lab](https://villani.mgh.harvard.edu/). We use single-cell genomics technology to study autoimmunity and autoimmunity-like iRAE induced by checkpoint inhibitors.

Prior to this, I double-majored in Mathematics and Computational Biology at Colby College. During my undergraduate, I was  privileged to be mentored by [Dr. Nam Sy Vo](https://vingen.vinbigdata.org/en/teams/vo-sy-nam/) at the Vingroup BigData and [Dr. Alice Lee](https://compgen.hms.harvard.edu/)   at the Boston Children's Hospital, where I studied functional genomics and the landscape of Transposable Elements in Alzheimer's, respectively. 

**Research:** I am interested in learning more about the biological landscape of Complex Diseases, such as Neurodegenerative Diseases or Autoimmune Conditions, using computational methods and modelling frameworks for nextgen sequencing data such as single-cell multi-omics data. My learning philosophy is by doing and reinventing the wheels - which I think are very rewarding and challenging simultaneously. Sometimes dissecting existing tools will help us learn about the conventional way of doing, and maybe invent our methods along the way.
