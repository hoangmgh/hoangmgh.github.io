I didn't take that many photos these couple of years using my Sony A7. I decided it might be a good idea to enjoy and spend time in  nature a bit without looking at it through a lenses. Regardless, I tried to take more photos using my Iphone 11. It wasn't ideal for what I considered to be a supreme piece of arts, but it did the work, and I had a good time creating some memorable arts.
