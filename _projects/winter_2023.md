My neighborhood - Inman square. The town is a bit dead during the winter, but not devoid of fun and beautiful scenes:

Imagine  strolling along the Cambridge street and this hit you: 
<div class="row">
    {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/arts/2023/w2.jpg" title="cambridge_2023.2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
The small bridge connecting Cambridge (Lechmere) and Charlestown. I biked through this route the other day and I would not recommend biking under the snow:
